# H4XOR-News
I developed this project using SwiftUI and Swift with the help of Udemy Course by "Dr.Angela Yu".

#What we will create
By the end of the module, we will have made a beautiful hackernews app and also we are going to use Application Programming Interface(APIs) to grab live data from internet. We will be able to read and go through the article as well.
